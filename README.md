I followed this tutorial for this guide: https://www.positronx.io/react-mern-stack-crud-app-tutorial/#tc_6139_08
I ran into a lot of errors and problems with this tutorial and needed to fix a lot of the turorial code because it's a bit outdated because react router dom has been updated since this tutorial was made. I changed  a lot in the edit student component for it to work.

I wouldn't really recommend following this tutorial for this guide. But the functionality works like it should! :)
